# `26` Two dimensional array

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a program which takes 2 digits, X,Y as input and generates a 2-dimensional array. The element value in the i-th row and j-th column of the array should be i*j.

Note: i=0,1.., X-1; j=0,1,¡­Y-1.


```text
Q = Square root of (2 * c * d) / h
```

*Following are the fixed values of `c` and `h`:*

+ `c` is 50.
+ `h` is 30.
+ `d` would be the parameter of the function.

## 📎 Example input:

```py
two_dimensional_array(3,5)
```

## 📎 Example output:

```py
[[0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]]
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ If the output received is in decimal form, it should be rounded off to its nearest value (for example, if the output received is 26.0, it should be printed as 26).

+ Import the `math` module.
