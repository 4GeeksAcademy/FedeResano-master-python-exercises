# `08` Hours and Minutes

In this exercise we are going to suppose that it is midnight, we want that with the function `hours_minutes` that we have provided for you tell us how much time has passed since then with the seconds that are introduced as parameter.

## üìù Instructions:

1. Complete the function to return the expected result.

2. Perform two calculations with the seconds that are passed by parameter in the function so that one calculates the time according to the seconds that have passed and the other to know the minutes `(hour , minutes)`.

## Example input:
```py
3900 # 1

60 # 2
```

## Example output:
```py
(2, 5) # 1

(0, 1) # 2
```
